Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404
# CP1404 Practicals – README

## About This Repository
This repository contains all weekly practical work for **CP1404/CP5632 – Programming II at James Cook University (JCU)**.  
The practicals focus on building strong programming fundamentals, including clean code, functions, object-oriented design, testing, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

**Author:** Sadman Noman Swopnil

## Clean Code Lessons Learned
Throughout the practicals, I have improved my coding style and understanding of good software practices.  
Key lessons include:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Write small, focused functions that each handle one clear task.  
- **Avoid Magic Numbers:** Use named **constants** to improve readability and maintainability.  
- **Meaningful Naming:** Follow PEP8 and JCU guidelines: functions use verbs (`get_`, `calculate_`), booleans use `is_`/`has_`, and variables are descriptive.  
- **Input–Processing–Output Separation:** Keep logic functions pure, avoiding mixing user input with computation.  
- **DRY Principle:** Avoid duplicated logic—reuse functions to simplify maintenance.  
- **Standard File Structure:**  
  Module docstring → imports → CONSTANTS → `main()` → helper functions →  
  `if __name__ == "__main__": main()`
