# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?
At the start, my estimates were mostly inaccurate. I often assumed tasks would take less time than they 
actually did. Even simple sections became longer once I started coding, especially when unexpected bugs 
appeared or when the instructions required more detail than I first realised. Because of this, my early
estimates were usually too optimistic.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?
As I progressed, my estimates became much more accurate. I learned to base them on previous pracs instead
of guessing. I also split tasks into smaller pieces and estimated each part separately. By the later 
pracs, my predicted times were much closer to the actual time because I understood the difficulty level
better.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?
I learned that estimating is a planning tool, not just a guess. It made me think about the complexity 
of each prac before starting and helped me prepare for debugging and testing time. Comparing my planned 
and actual time also helped me understand my work habits and improve my organisation.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?
Being reviewed showed me how helpful another perspective can be. Reviewers pointed out unclear logic,
repeated code, naming issues, or where functions needed better structure. Their feedback helped me 
improve my readability, design, and consistency with the CP1404 programming patterns.

## Practicals

### Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
If I were in charge, I would add more short walkthrough examples before big pracs, especially for Kivy 
and Flask. Seeing a small demo would help students understand the structure before writing the full
solution. I would also include optional extension challenges for students who want extra practice, 
without increasing the required workload.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
