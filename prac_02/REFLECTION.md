 """CP1404 Practical 02 – Reflection

Lecture videos watched so far
I’ve managed to watch about 60% of the lecture videos. I’m slowly building momentum and plan to keep improving this.

My lecture routine
Most of the time, I watch the lectures at night when it’s quiet and easier to focus. I usually watch from home for about 30 minutes to an hour each session.

What I’m doing well
I’ve been sticking to a clean program structure — starting with a main() function and then breaking the problem into smaller, focused functions. I’m also keeping my GitHub repository tidy and updated by committing and pushing after completing each task.

What I want to improve
I want to stop pushing empty or unfinished files to GitHub. From now on, I’ll make sure my code works locally before uploading it.

Practical skills to develop
I want to get into the habit of writing pseudocode first for every program. It should help me think clearly before coding. I also plan to use a code linter and formatter every time before pushing my work so it stays clean and consistent.

Strengths to continue
I’m already using constants instead of magic numbers (like MIN_SCORE and MAX_SCORE), and I write short, clear docstrings and choose descriptive, action-based names for my functions. These habits make my code much easier to read and maintain.
