 """CP1404 Practical 02 – Reflection

Lecture videos watched so far
- Watched: about 60% so far

My lecture schedule
- When: I usually watch lecture videos at night.
- Where: At home.
- Duration per session: 30 minutes to 1 hour.

What I’m doing well (keep doing)
- Following the standard program structure by starting with main() and breaking tasks into small, focused functions.
- Committing and pushing changes at the end of each task so my GitHub stays up to date.

What I need to stop or change
- Stop leaving empty files on GitHub — I’ll write the code locally first, then commit and push once it’s ready.

Practicals – improvements to focus on
- Begin each file with clear, structured pseudocode.
- Run the linter/formatter before pushing to maintain clean, consistent code.

Practicals – strengths to maintain
- Using constants instead of magic numbers (e.g., MIN_SCORE, MAX_SCORE).
- Writing short, clear docstrings and using descriptive, action-based function names.
